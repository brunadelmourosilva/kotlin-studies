## Annotations

- @Composable

Composables are Kotlin functions annotated with @Composable. They can define anything from a single UI element, like a button or a text field, to a complete screen or a part of it.
We can create our own composable element to allow for reusable and modular code. It's like creating custom annotations in Spring Boot.

- @Preview

It lets you see what your app’s screen or a part of it will look like without running the whole app on a phone or emulator.

## Feature classes

- Context

It’s like a messenger that helps parts of your app talk to the operating system and access resources, services, and other stuff.

- Toast

It's a quick message that pops up on the screen. It’s a way to give users a short message or feedback, like “Message sent” or “Error occurred.”
